SDOH_CLINICAL_PROMPT  = """
                You are tasked with reviewing a patient’s clinical note along with their Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) items. Your goal is to generate a comprehensive, concise, and human-understandable clinical report.
                For your report, follow these steps:

                ### Step 1: Review the SDoH items
                Carefully analyze the patient’s SDoH information, focusing on the following items that are strongly linked to cognitive impairments:

                1. **Social Isolation**
                2. **Nutrition / Food Insecurity**
                3. **Physical Activity Level**
                4. **Education Level**
                5. **Smoking / Tobacco Use**
                6. **Alcohol Use**

                If the values in the SDoH items match the **threatening values** listed below, make sure to **explicitly mention them in the report**:

                - **Social Isolation**: Severely isolated
                - **Nutrition / Food Insecurity**: Often skips meals due to lack of food
                - **Physical Activity Level**: Sedentary
                - **Education Level**: No formal education, Primary
                - **Smoking / Tobacco Use**: Current
                - **Alcohol Use**: Alcoholic

                ### Step 2: Analyze the Clinical Note
                Review the patient’s clinical note and identify any points that indicate an **imminent threat** or signs that could be directly and strongly associated with cognitive impairments.

                ### Step 3: Generate the Clinical Report
                Your clinical report should contain the following:

                - **SDoH items**: Identify and list only the items that match the **threatening values** listed above. **Highlight and bold these** values in the report in a clear and readable format as **Bold** structure.

                - **Imminent threats from the clinical note**: Identify and summarize **any clinical note points** that strongly suggest risks for cognitive impairments.

                - **Negative Points**: For any **negative conditions and Imminent threats** you found , be sure to format them as **Bold**. This ensures they stand out and become bolded in the report.

                ### Step 4: Formatting and Tone
                Maintain a clinical, factual tone and  be **natural, clear, and concise** —avoid bullet points or itemized lists, I want a coherent and cohesive paragraph.
                It is very important that you **DO NOT** explicitly mention in the report paragraph that the patient has or does not have cognitive impairments.
                It is very important to include ALL information but **BOLD**:
                  1. SDoH items that match the **threatening values** listed above. (e.g The patient is ** Severely isolated **)
                  2. **Negative** or **Imminent threats** you found in the clinical report. (e.g The paitient chief complaint is ** headache **)
                Eliminate redundant terms and keep the narrative concise, do not add any explanation, note, title, etc. only a paragraph as the report.
                Use the example below to guide tone, structure, and style.

                ### Example output:
                The patient reports having a **Sedentary** lifestyle, primarily due to mobility limitations, and feels **socially isolated**, often relying on neighbors for occasional transportation assistance.

  Given the following four types of interpretation, your task is to extract the most significant factor from each interpretation that is strongly and directly associated
  with cognitive impairments. Compare all the items in each interpretation and select the one that stands out the most based on its direct relationship to cognitive decline or impairment.
  Your response should focus on selecting the item from each category that has the most notable connection to cognitive impairment symptoms.

  Interpretations:

  - SDoH (Social Determinants of Health):
  {SDoH}

  - Clinical (Medical History and Symptoms):
  {Clinical}

  - Acoustic (Speech Features and Patterns):
  {Acoustic}

  - Linguistic (Language Use and Structure):
  {Linguistic}

  Instructions for the Model:
  1. For each interpretation type (SDoH, Clinical, Acoustic, Linguistic), compare the individual items presented and evaluate which one most strongly relates to cognitive impairments.
  2. The selected item should be the one that most directly reflects or correlates with cognitive decline or dementia-related symptoms.
  3. Write the selected item as a natural, human-undesrstandable, and concise **COMPLETE SENTENCE**.
  4. Output the selected significant factors for each interpretation type in the following format:
